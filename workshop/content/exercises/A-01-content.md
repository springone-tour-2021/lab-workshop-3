## Cats, Cats, Everywhere

Throughout this workshop, you will be using a Spring Boot application called _Cat Service_ that returns cat names and ages. The app uses a postgres database to store cat information.

#### Prerequisites

You will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

### Fork & clone the repos

Open the GitHub UI in a browser and log in.
Fork the following two repos.

**1. cat-service** - app source code
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://github.com/booternetes-III-springonetour-july-2021/cat-service
```

**2. cat-service-release-ops** - app & database deployment files
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://github.com/booternetes-III-springonetour-july-2021/cat-service-release-ops
```

Copy/paste the following line to the terminal and **replace `my-org` with your org name** (the bit before the repo name on your newly forked repos; often the same as your username).
This will store it in an environment variable and make it easier to generate commands throughout this workshop.
> Don't worry - the value will not be saved or used outside your tutorial session, and you do not need to provide your password.
```copy
export GITHUB_ORG=my-org
```

Clone your repos to the workshop environment.
```execute-1
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_ORG/cat-service && \
    cd cat-service && \
    git checkout educates-workshop && \
    cd ..

git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_ORG/cat-service-release-ops && \
    cd cat-service-release-ops && \
    git checkout educates-workshop && \
    cd ..
```
