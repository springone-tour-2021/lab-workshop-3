Now that the code is tested, you can start the process of deploying to Kubernetes.

First order of business is to package it as a container image.

A container image is a deployment artifact that is compatible with container runtime systems such Docker and Kubernetes, and which contains not only the application but also the runtime (JRE) and OS file system.

In the next exercises, you'll build the image manually first and then automate the process.

## Build the image

The Spring Boot [maven](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#build-image) and [gradle](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#build-image) build plugins make it easy to build images. 
Run the following command to generate an image for cat-service.
```execute-1
cd ~/cat-service
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -DskipTests
```

_As an aside.... notice the following line in the build output.
[Paketo Buildpacks](https://paketo.io) are doing the hard work of turning your app into an image.
Make a mental note of this.
We will come back to it later in the workshop._
```
[INFO]  > Pulling builder image 'docker.io/paketobuildpacks/builder:base' 100%
```

## Push the image

When the build completes, check for the resulting image on the local Docker daemon.
```execute-1
docker images | grep cat-service
```

In order to depoy it to Kubernetes, you must push the image to an image registry so Kubernetes can access. A registry is included in your tutorial environment.

Tag the image with the registry address and push it to the registry.
```execute-1
docker tag cat-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/cat-service
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/cat-service
```

You can use the [skopeo CLI](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to verify that the image has been pushed to the registry.
```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/cat-service
```

## Next steps

Next you will automate the deployment process.
